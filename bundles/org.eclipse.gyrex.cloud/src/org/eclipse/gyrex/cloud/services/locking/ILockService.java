/**
 * A simple locking service.
 * <p>
 * A locking service allows to create distributed locks which guarantee that at
 * any point into time no two clients hold the same lock. It provides different
 * type of locks for various use cases. However, it does not define any strong
 * guarantees about typical lock characteristics (eg., fairness) but an
 * underlying implementation may do so.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is very important that acquired locks eventually get released. Calls to
 * release should be done in a finally block to ensure they execute.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ILockService lockService = ...;
 * ILock lock = lockService.acquire...(...);
 * try {
 *   // ... do work here ...
 * } finally {
 *   lock.release();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This interface is typically not implemented by clients but by service
 * providers. As such it is considered part of a service provider API which may
 * evolve faster than the general API. Please get in touch with the development
 * team through the prefered channels listed on <a
 * href="http://www.eclipse.org/gyrex">the Gyrex website</a> to stay up-to-date
 * of possible changes for implementors.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
