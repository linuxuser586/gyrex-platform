/**
 * This package defines the repository storage model.
 * <p>
 * The CloudFree Platform supports a distributed architecture. This 
 * also applies to persistent data. In order to allow data to be stored on 
 * various systems using different technologies the concept of repository 
 * abstraction is introduced. It allows to partition data of various types 
 * across different data stores. The data stores can be - for example - 
 * relational databases, object oriented databased, LDAP databases, other 
 * file based stores, etc. There will be no limitation on the repository 
 * type.
